                    <h3>Why is the audit free?</h3>
                    <p>We offer the free audit because we're confident in our ability to find significant problems that are costing you customers. Once you see the value in our analysis, many clients choose to have us implement the fixes. But there's no obligation - you can take the audit and run with it yourself if you prefer.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">

                <div class="testimonial">
                    <blockquote>"The free audit alone was worth thousands of dollars. It found problems I didn't even know existed that were costing me customers every day. The fixes they recommended increased my leads by 180% in just two months."</blockquote>

                <p>Consider this: if your website is currently getting 1,000 visitors per month but only 1% are becoming customers (10 people), improving your conversion rate to 3% would give you 30 customers instead of 10.</p>
                
                <p>If each customer is worth $100 to your business:</p>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Current monthly revenue from website:</strong> $1,000</li>
                    <li><strong>Potential monthly revenue:</strong> $3,000</li>
