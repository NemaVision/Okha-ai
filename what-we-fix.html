                <h1>The Website Problems That Cost You Customers</h1>
                
                <p>After auditing hundreds of small business websites, we've found that most share the same problems. These issues drive customers away every single day - but they're all fixable.</p>
                
                <p>Here are the most common problems we find and how they hurt your business:</p>
                
                <div style="margin: 3rem 0;">
                    <h2>üêå Your Website is Too Slow</h2>
                    <div class="report-section">
                        <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> If your website takes more than 3 seconds to load, people leave. Most small business websites take 6-10 seconds to load.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Why This Happens:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="checkmark-list">
                            <li>Images are too large and not optimized</li>
                            <li>Too many plugins or fancy features</li>
                            <li>Poor web hosting</li>
                            <li>Outdated website code</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p><strong>What This Costs You:</strong> For every 1-second delay in loading time, you lose 7% of potential customers. A 5-second load time means you're losing 35% of your visitors before they even see your website.</p>

                        <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Over 60% of people browse the internet on their phones, but many business websites are still designed only for desktop computers.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Why This Happens:</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>What This Costs You:</strong> Google prioritizes mobile-friendly websites in search results. If your site doesn't work on mobile, you'll rank lower and get fewer visitors.</p>

                    <blockquote>"I had no idea my website was losing me so many customers. The audit found 8 major problems - things like my contact form wasn't working on mobile and my site took 12 seconds to load! After fixing just the top 3 issues, I started getting twice as many phone calls."</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>"The biggest surprise was learning that people couldn't find my business on Google because of technical issues I didn't even know existed. Once we fixed the SEO problems, my website traffic doubled in just two months."</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>"I thought my website looked fine, but the audit showed me it looked completely broken on phones. Since 70% of my customers use mobile, I was basically invisible to most of my potential clients. The mobile fixes made a huge difference."</blockquote>
