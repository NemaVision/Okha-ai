                <h1>We Help Small Businesses Get More Customers</h1>
                
                <p>Hi, I'm the founder of Okha.ai. I started this company because I was frustrated watching small businesses struggle online while big corporations dominate.</p>
                
                <p>Here's what I noticed: Most small business websites have the same problems. They're slow, hard to use, don't work on phones, and can't be found on Google. But business owners don't know how to fix these issues - and most web developers either don't explain the problems clearly or charge too much to fix them.</p>
                
                <p>That's where we come in.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Mission is Simple</h2>
                <p>We want to level the playing field. Every small business deserves a website that actually brings in customers, not one that drives them away.</p>
                
                <p>We do this by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Finding the real problems</strong> - Not just surface issues, but the things that actually hurt your business</li>
                    <li><strong>Explaining everything clearly</strong> - No confusing tech jargon, just simple explanations</li>
                    <li><strong>Giving you solutions that work</strong> - Practical steps you can take to fix your website</li>
                    <li><strong>Focusing on results</strong> - Everything we do is designed to get you more customers</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Why We're Different</h2>

                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>I've been building websites for over 10 years. I've worked with everyone from Fortune 500 companies to local mom-and-pop shops. And here's what I learned:</p>
                
                <p>Big companies have teams of people working on their websites. They have data analysts, user experience experts, and marketing specialists all working together to make sure their websites convert visitors into customers.</p>
                
                <p>Small businesses don't have those resources. They usually get a website built once and then never think about it again. Meanwhile, that website could be losing them hundreds of customers every month.</p>
                
                <p>That's not fair. And it's not necessary.</p>
                
                <p>With the right knowledge and tools, any small business can have a website that competes with the big guys. That's what Okha.ai is all about.</p>
                
                <h2>What Makes Us Qualified</h2>

                    <h3>How long have you been doing this?</h3>
                    <p>I've been building and optimizing websites for over 10 years, working with businesses of all sizes. Okha.ai was founded specifically to help small businesses compete online.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <h3>Do you only work with certain types of businesses?</h3>
                    <p>No, we work with all kinds of small businesses - restaurants, retail stores, service providers, healthcare practices, and more. The problems that hurt websites are similar across industries.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <h3>What if I already have a web developer?</h3>
                    <p>That's great! Our audit can help you and your developer prioritize what to fix first. Many developers focus on making websites look good, but miss the things that actually bring in customers.</p>

                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <h3>How is this different from other website audits?</h3>
                    <p>Most audits are either too technical or too surface-level. We focus specifically on the issues that impact your ability to get customers, and we explain everything in terms you can understand and act on.</p>
