                            <p>I didn't start this company because I love technology. I started it because I watched my father struggle with something that shouldn't have been so hard.</p>

                            <h2>My Father's Story</h2>
                            <p>My dad, Donnie Henderson, spent 30 years hauling cars across the country. He was the kind of man who could diagnose engine trouble by sound and fix almost anything with his hands. But when he started his own car hauling business, he hit a wall he couldn't fix with tools.</p>
                            
                            <p>He needed customers to find him online. He needed a website that actually worked. He needed to compete with bigger companies that had fancy websites and marketing teams.</p>
                            
                            <p>Dad spent thousands of dollars on web developers and marketing "experts" who promised him the world. What he got were websites that looked pretty but brought him zero customers. Phone calls that never came. Money down the drain.</p>
                        </div>

                    <h2>The Moment Everything Changed</h2>
                    <p>I'll never forget the conversation we had in 2019. Dad was sitting at his kitchen table, surrounded by bills from web developers and marketing companies. He looked defeated.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote class="family-quote">
                        "Donna, I've spent more on this website stuff than I did on my first truck. And I still don't have a single customer who found me online. I don't understand why it's so complicated."
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>That's when I realized something was fundamentally broken about how small businesses get help online.</p>
                    
                    <p>The web development industry was built to serve big corporations with unlimited budgets and dedicated IT teams. Small business owners like my dad - people who built America with their bare hands - were getting left behind by overcomplicated solutions and inflated prices.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>What I Learned From Dad's Struggles</h2>
                <p>Watching my father's experience taught me three critical things about what small business owners really need:</p>
                
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Straight talk, not tech jargon</strong> - Dad needed someone to explain things in plain English, not confuse him with technical terms</li>
                    <li><strong>Solutions that actually work</strong> - He didn't need a pretty website; he needed a website that brought him customers</li>
                    <li><strong>Fair pricing for real results</strong> - He shouldn't have to choose between feeding his family and growing his business</li>
                    <li><strong>Someone who understands small business</strong> - The people helping him should know what it's like to make payroll and worry about next month's bills</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Why I Built Okha.ai</h2>
                <p>I founded Okha.ai because every small business owner deserves what my father never got: honest help at a fair price that actually brings in customers.</p>
                
                <p>We use AI not to replace the human touch, but to work faster and more affordably than traditional agencies. What used to take months and cost $15,000, we can now deliver in two weeks for $2,497.</p>
                
                <p>But here's what hasn't changed: We still treat every client like family. We still explain everything in plain English. And we still measure our success by how many more customers you get, not how impressive your website looks to other web developers.</p>

                <h2>Dad's Success Story (Finally)</h2>
                <p>The good news? Dad's story has a happy ending. After I started Okha.ai, he became one of my first clients. We completely rebuilt his car hauling website using everything I'd learned about what actually works for small businesses.</p>
                
                <p>Within 90 days, he was getting 3-4 new customer calls per week from his website. He went from struggling to find loads to having to turn down work because he was booked solid.</p>
                
                <p>More importantly, he finally understood how his website worked and why customers were calling. No more confusion, no more wasted money, no more sitting at the kitchen table wondering what went wrong.</p>
                
                <blockquote class="family-quote">
                    "Donna, I should have asked you to do this from the beginning. For the first time in years, I'm not worried about where my next load is coming from."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>That's the moment I knew we were onto something special.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Mission: No More Struggling Small Business Owners</h2>
                <p>Every time I help a small business owner get more customers from their website, I think about my dad and all the years he struggled unnecessarily.</p>
                
                <p>I can't go back and fix his early struggles, but I can make sure no other small business owner has to go through what he did.</p>
                
                <p>That's why Okha.ai exists: to be the honest, affordable, results-focused help that my father needed but never found until it was almost too late.</p>
                
                <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>We're family-owned and operated</strong> - We know what it's like to worry about making payroll</li>
                    <li><strong>We speak small business</strong> - No tech jargon, just clear explanations of what needs to be fixed and why</li>
                    <li><strong>We focus on customers, not awards</strong> - Your website's job is to bring you business, period</li>
                    <li><strong>We price fairly</strong> - $2,497 for work that used to cost $15,000+ because AI helps us work faster</li>
                    <li><strong>We guarantee results</strong> - If you don't get more customers in 90 days, we work for free until you do</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Our Guarantee</h2>
                <p>We're so confident in our audit process that we offer this guarantee: If you follow our recommendations and don't see an improvement in your website's performance within 90 days, we'll work with you for free until you do.</p>
                
                <p>That's how much we believe in what we do.</p>

                    <h3>How long have you been doing this?</h3>
                    <p>I've been building and optimizing websites for over 10 years, working with businesses of all sizes. Okha.ai was founded specifically to help small businesses compete online.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <h3>Do you only work with certain types of businesses?</h3>
                    <p>No, we work with all kinds of small businesses - restaurants, retail stores, service providers, healthcare practices, and more. The problems that hurt websites are similar across industries.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>What if I already have a web developer?</h3>
                    <p>That's great! Our audit can help you and your developer prioritize what to fix first. Many developers focus on making websites look good, but miss the things that actually bring in customers.</p>

                    <h3>How is this different from other website audits?</h3>
                    <p>Most audits are either too technical or too surface-level. We focus specifically on the issues that impact your ability to get customers, and we explain everything in terms you can understand and act on.</p>
