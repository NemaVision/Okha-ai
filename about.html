                            <p>I understand the struggles because I've lived them. Coming from a small business family, I've seen firsthand what business owners really need - more customers, not more confusion.</p>

                            <h2>The Family Business That Started It All</h2>
                            <p>My father's trucking business taught me what small business owners really need. He spent 30 years working with his hands, building something from nothing. He could fix any engine, navigate any route, but when it came to getting customers online, he hit a wall.</p>
                            
                            <p>He needed customers to find him online. He needed a website that actually worked. He needed to compete with bigger companies that had fancy websites and marketing teams.</p>
                            
                            <p>He spent thousands of dollars on web developers and marketing "experts" who promised him the world. What he got were websites that looked pretty but brought him zero customers. Phone calls that never came. Money down the drain.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                <div class="realization-section">
                    <h2>Living Across Small-Town America</h2>
                    <p>I've lived across small-town America and work as a digital transformation expert. Through visiting small businesses in these communities, I've seen the same story everywhere: hardworking owners struggling to bring in customers online.</p>
                    
                    <blockquote class="family-quote">
                        "I've spent more on this website stuff than I did on my first truck. And I still don't have a single customer who found me online. I don't understand why it's so complicated."
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>That's when I realized something was fundamentally broken about how small businesses get help online.</p>
                    
                    <p>The web development industry was built to serve big corporations with unlimited budgets and dedicated IT teams. Small business owners - people who built America with their bare hands - were getting left behind by overcomplicated solutions and inflated prices.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h2>What I Learned From Dad's Struggles</h2>
                <p>Watching my father's experience taught me three critical things about what small business owners really need:</p>
                
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>Straight talk, not tech jargon</strong> - Dad needed someone to explain things in plain English, not confuse him with technical terms</li>
                    <li><strong>Solutions that actually work</strong> - He didn't need a pretty website; he needed a website that brought him customers</li>
                    <li><strong>Fair pricing for real results</strong> - He shouldn't have to choose between feeding his family and growing his business</li>
                    <li><strong>Someone who understands small business</strong> - The people helping him should know what it's like to make payroll and worry about next month's bills</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Why I Built Okha.ai</h2>
                <p>I founded Okha.ai because every small business owner deserves what my father never got: honest help at a fair price that actually brings in customers.</p>
                
                <p>We use AI not to replace the human touch, but to work faster and more affordably than traditional agencies. What used to take months and cost $15,000, we can now deliver in two weeks for $2,497.</p>
                
                <p>But here's what hasn't changed: We still treat every client like family. We still explain everything in plain English. And we still measure our success by how many more customers you get, not how impressive your website looks to other web developers.</p>

                <h2>Why I Started Okha.ai</h2>
                <p>That's why I started Okha.ai - to help businesses across small-town America compete using AI tools that level the playing field.</p>
                
                <p>I've seen what happens when small businesses get the right help. Within 90 days of fixing their websites properly, they start getting 3-4 new customer calls per week. They go from struggling to find customers to having to turn down work because they're booked solid.</p>
                
                <p>More importantly, they finally understand how their website works and why customers are calling. No more confusion, no more wasted money, no more wondering what went wrong.</p>
                
                <blockquote class="family-quote">
                    "For the first time in years, I'm not worried about where my next customer is coming from. My website actually works."
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>That's the result I want for every small business owner.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Mission: No More Struggling Small Business Owners</h2>
                <p>Every time I help a small business owner get more customers from their website, I think about all the hardworking families struggling to grow their businesses online.</p>
                
                <p>I can't go back and fix past struggles, but I can make sure no other small business owner has to go through what so many have experienced.</p>
                
                <p>That's why Okha.ai exists: to be the honest, affordable, results-focused help that small business families need to compete in today's digital world.</p>
                
                <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
                <ul class="checkmark-list">
                    <li><strong>We're family-owned and operated</strong> - We know what it's like to worry about making payroll</li>
                    <li><strong>We speak small business</strong> - No tech jargon, just clear explanations of what needs to be fixed and why</li>
                    <li><strong>We focus on customers, not awards</strong> - Your website's job is to bring you business, period</li>
                    <li><strong>We price fairly</strong> - $2,497 for work that used to cost $15,000+ because AI helps us work faster</li>
                    <li><strong>We guarantee results</strong> - If you don't get more customers in 90 days, we work for free until you do</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Our Guarantee</h2>
                <p>We're so confident in our audit process that we offer this guarantee: If you follow our recommendations and don't see an improvement in your website's performance within 90 days, we'll work with you for free until you do.</p>

                    <h3>How long have you been doing this?</h3>
                    <p>I've been building and optimizing websites for over 10 years, working with businesses of all sizes. Okha.ai was founded specifically to help small businesses compete online.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Do you only work with certain types of businesses?</h3>
                    <p>No, we work with all kinds of small businesses - restaurants, retail stores, service providers, healthcare practices, and more. The problems that hurt websites are similar across industries.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <h3>What if I already have a web developer?</h3>
                    <p>That's great! Our audit can help you and your developer prioritize what to fix first. Many developers focus on making websites look good, but miss the things that actually bring in customers.</p>

                <div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <h3>How is this different from other website audits?</h3>
                    <p>Most audits are either too technical or too surface-level. We focus specifically on the issues that impact your ability to get customers, and we explain everything in terms you can understand and act on.</p>
